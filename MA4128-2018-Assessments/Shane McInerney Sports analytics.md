## Sports Analytics

Over the past few years, the world of sports has experienced an explosion in the use of analytics. 
In this three-part series, we reflect on the current state of sports analytics and consider 
what the future of sports analytics may look like.

We define sports analytics as “the management of structured historical data, 
the application of predictive analytic models that utilize that data, and the use of 
information systems to inform decision makers and enable them to help their organizations in 
gaining a competitive advantage on the field of play.” Our definition is both expansive 
(in the sense that it includes not only statistical models but also the broader information value 
chain that surrounds these models) and restrictive (because it excludes traditional analytics applications 
such as demand forecasting, revenue management and financial modeling, all of which are certainly relevant in 
the business of professional sports). Our framework for sports analytics is presented in the image below.

Data management includes any and all processes associated with acquiring, verifying and storing data in an efficient manner. 
In a sports organization, data can come from a variety of sources and may be presented in many different forms.

As shown in the image, the data management function will feed both the predictive analytics function and the information 
systems that support decision-makers. Given this crucial role, good data management is essential, and therefore missing, 
incomplete and/or inaccessible data inherently reduces the value of any other investments in analytics.

In many organizations, data is often stored in isolated silos, so that getting data is often not a smooth process. 
Different groups within an organization such as scouting or training may have extensive data on players that other 
groups either do not have access to or do not even know exist.

For example, the personnel group at one NFL team had been collecting extensive performance data on various groups of 
both opposing players and their own players. The coaching staff had no idea that the data existed, but when they did 
discover it, they had difficulty accessing it. The data resided in spreadsheets on the computers of the personnel group 
instead of being integrated into a common data archive. This is a common situation within professional sports organizations.

## What can be done using data
Data within a sports organization used to consist of individual box scores, player and team summary statistics, 
text-based scouting reports and raw game films. However, the data available to decision-makers has grown exponentially 
over the last 15 years.

Several factors have contributed to this explosion in data. Innovations in sports science, ranging from training 
routines to nutritional regimens, coupled with improved reporting from medical staffs and trainers have all come 
with their own data sets that are gathered and tracked somewhere within an organization. With improved communications 
via the Internet, the frequency and amount of information captured, stored and distributed by scouts and coaches at all 
levels has grown significantly. Thanks to increased computing power and reduced storage costs, historical data about 
the games themselves is now packaged into many different formats, with companies such as Stats LLC, StatDNA and Sports
Data Hub emerging to provide organizations with high-quality historical data presented with unique summaries and indexes.

Finally, the advent of motion capture technology has expanded the data collected from each game. This technology 
tracks everything that moves on a field every 100th of a second. The impact of this is staggering for it transforms 
the amount of information captured for a single game from a few hundred rows of data to well over one million. Major 
League Baseball, the NBA and pro soccer teams have implemented this type of technology.

The result of all of this is clear: The world of sports generates far, far more data today than could have been 
imagined just a few short years ago. Dean Oliver, director of Publication Analytics at ESPN, has spoken of finding
“data that can win championships.”

However, as the computer scientist Clifford Stoll has said, “Data is not information, information is not knowledge, 
knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom.” Too much time is still spent by analysts using their 
skills to try and answer questions that are not meaningful to decision-makers in pro sports. For example, very little
is interesting about the next new statistic that ranks all NBA players. General managers do not lose sleep trying to 
figure out who the best player in the game is, as that information is neither accurate nor actionable. Conversely, 
Mark Cuban, owner and general manager of the Dallas Mavericks, has often cited studies that either predict or examine 
the effects of injuries as delivering useful and actionable information to his coaching staff and team.

In other words, despite the remarkable growth in the amount and variety of data available of examination and analysis, 
the world of sports analytics still faces the same ubiquitous challenge: How to get meaningful information into the 
hands – and minds – of the people who are in a position to make effective use of it.
