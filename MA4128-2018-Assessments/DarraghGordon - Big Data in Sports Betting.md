*In a numbers game, whoever has the most information usually ends up winning. That has largely been the thinking in the gambling industry, with the house having the better odds in any game that is played. Gambling is already all about the numbers, so it should probably come as no surprise that the rise of big data has caught industry leaders’ attention.*

## What is Big Data in Sports Betting?

The first people to adopt big data in the gambling world were the bookmakers -- those that live by the odds they establish. Getting as much information as possible is a crucial aspect of the business, so the moment new techniques designed to analyze and transmit that data cropped up, adopting it was a simple decision to make. The traditional data warehousing strategy was unneeded, especially since data needed to be accessed almost in the moment. Betting firms quickly utilized big data analytics as a way to manage their businesses and stay on top of the game.

At the same time, other companies saw the potential of actually placing the odds more in favor of the gamers themselves. Big data services quickly appeared that were designed to empower gamblers, giving them more information and helping them strategize more effectively. One such site that made full use of big data was SharkScope, which collects data from millions of online poker games every day. Players can track all their statistics on the site as a way to improve and increase their chances of winning. SharkScope quickly discovered that as the company gathered more data, querying would take longer, so they adopted new big data tools allowing for faster querying and use of ad hoc data to provide a much desired service for gamblers.

## History

Before 19g94 ambling was a thing that was either done over a counter or any other physical means of gambling such as a slot machine or playing at a real poker/black jack table. Since 1994 gambling has taken to the internet and become a virtual sensation. Gmbling online gives the large bookmakers/online casinos an advantage over the punter, this is due to the ability to read into trends with the use of being able to harvest and analyse that, whether its reading into form of a horse or a soccer team. Using this valuable data the bookmaker can adjust the odds in their favour, giving them the upper hand over the punter. With technology rapidly advancing big data has allowed online gambling to carry out in-play betting in all most all sporting games. This requires odds to be adjusted instantaneously so that the bookmaker never give the punter an advantage, this is all due to huge amounts of data being compiled together to give you the odds which are seen on in-play sporting events.
