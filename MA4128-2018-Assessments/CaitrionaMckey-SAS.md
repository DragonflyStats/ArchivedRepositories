## History of SAS
SAS (pronounced "sass")once stood for "statistical analysis system". It began at North Carolina State University as a project to analyze agricultural research.Demand for such software capabilities began to grow, and SAS was founded in 1976 to help customers in all sorts of industries – from pharmaceutical companies and banks to academic and governmental entities.

SAS – both the software and the company – thrived throughout the next few decades. Development of the software attained new heights in the industry because it could run across all platforms, using the multivendor architecture for which it is known today. While the scope of the company has spread across the globe, the encouraging and innovative corporate culture has remained the same.

## SAS Today
The World Headquarters of SAS in in Cary, North Carolina, USA. Today SAS software is installed in more than 83,000 business, government and university sites. SAS has customers in 149 countries and has a total of 14,175 employees. In 2016, 94 of the top 100 companies on the Fortune Global 500 were SAS customers. In 2017 SAS had a world revenue of US$3.24 billion.

## Products
As of 2011 SAS's largest set of products is its line for customer intelligence. Numerous SAS modules for web, social media and marketing analytics may be used to profile customers and prospects, predict their behaviors and manage and optimize communications. SAS also provides the SAS Fraud Framework. The framework's primary functionality is to monitor transactions across different applications, networks and partners and use analytics to identify anomalies that are indicative of fraud. SAS Enterprise GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) provides risk modeling, scenario analysis and other functions, in order to manage and visualize risk, compliance and corporate policies. There is also a SAS Enterprise Risk Management product-set designed primarily for banks and financial services organizations.

SAS' products for monitoring and managing the operations of IT systems are collectively referred to as SAS IT Management Solutions. SAS collects data from various IT assets on performance and utilization, then creates reports and analyses.SAS' Performance Management products consolidate and provide graphical displays for key performance indicators (KPIs) at the employee, department and organizational level.The SAS Supply Chain Intelligence product suite is offered for supply chain needs, such as forecasting product demand, managing distribution and inventory and optimizing pricing. There is also a "SAS for Sustainability Management" set of software to forecast environmental, social and economic effects and identify causal relationships between operations and an impact on the environment or ecosystem.

SAS has product sets for specific industries, such as government, retail, telecommunications and aerospace and for marketing optimization or high-performance computing.

## SAS Code
#### SAS Options

SAS includes a large suite of system options that will affect your SAS session. Specific options are invoked by default when you open SAS. The options can vary depending what computing environment you are using (e.g. Windows, Unix). The OPTIONS procedure lists the current settings of SAS system options in the SAS log.

PROC OPTIONS;
RUN;
SAS includes two types of options: portable and host.  Portable or nohost are options that are the same regardless of the operating system. Host options are different depending on which operating system you are using.

  #### SAS Color-Coded Syntax.

Color coding is used when executing code in SAS in the Enhanced Editor. Color coding program components help you diagnose syntax errors easily. In the below image, 5 different colors automatically generated by SAS are shown. Notice that keywords like DATA, CLASS, MODEL are all highlighted in blue. If the wrong keyword is used with a procedure, the keyword will often remain black like the variable names because SAS does not recognize it. Options like SOLUTION are also considered keywords. The way to indicate a format is to put a period at then end and, once you do this, it will turn green. Anything in quotation marks turns red. In the second set of code, an end quote is missing, thus all of the syntax is red. Thus missing double quote should be corrected.

#### Manipulating Datasets
Comparison Operators in SAS are operators that compare a variable with some specified value or another variable. They are typically represented as symbols such as =, <, > but also have mnemonic equivalents like EQ, LT, or GT, respectively. The operators can be used within a data or proc step depending on your needs.

One of the simplest ways to use a comparison operator is in a WHERE statement.  If we only wanted to output records of one vaiable we could use the = or eq operator. 

We also can specify SAS to output only certain ranges of values for numeric variables. 
The logical or Boolean operators include AND, OR, & NOT. They are often used to link a series of comparisons. Just like the comparison operators, these can be written as either symbols or mnemonics.  
Two WHERE statements can't be used in SAS but the AND operator can be used to combine the information contained in those two statements to achieve the desired result.


## Projects 
SAS are looking for new ways to use analytics to make a difference. SAS was founded on the principle of using analytics to change the world. From fighting cancer and researching the Zika virus to changing the lives of Ghana women by teaching them how to code, SAS has remained committed to helping solve critical humanitarian issues using data and analytics. One of SAS' current projects is called "Using big data to predict suicide risk among Canadian youth"
