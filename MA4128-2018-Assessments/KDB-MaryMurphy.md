KDB
=============
K is a proprietary array processing language developed by Arthur Whitney and commercialized by Kx Systems. Since then, an open-source implementation known as Kona has also been developed. The language serves as the foundation for kdb, an in-memory, column-based database, and other related financial products. The language, originally developed in 1993, is a variant of APL and contains elements of Scheme. Advocates of the language emphasize its speed, facility in handling arrays, and expressive syntax.

Before developing K, Arthur Whitney had worked extensively with APL, first at I. P. Sharp Associates alongside Ken Iverson and Roger Hui, and later at Morgan Stanley developing financial applications. At Morgan Stanley, Whitney helped to develop A+, a variant of APL, to facilitate the migration of APL applications from IBM mainframes to a network of Sun workstations. A+ had a smaller set of primitive functions and was designed for speed and to handle large sets of time series data. 

In 1993, Whitney left Morgan Stanley and developed the first version of the K language. At the same time he formed Kx Systems to commercialize the product and signed an exclusive contract with Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS). For the next four years he developed various financial and trading applications using K for UBS.

The contract ended in 1997 when UBS merged with Swiss Bank. In 1998, Kx Systems released kdb, a database built on K. kdb was anin-memory, column-oriented database and included ksql, a query language with a SQL-like syntax. Since then, a number of financial products have been developed with K and kdb. kdb/tick and kdb/taq were developed in 2001. kdb+, a 64-bit version of kdb was released in 2003 and kdb+/tick and kdb+/taq were released in 2004. kdb+ included Q, a language that merged the functionality of the underlying K language and ksql. 

Kx offers kdb+, a high-performance column-store database with a built-in expressive query and programming language, q. Used as a central repository to store time-series data within an enterprise, kdb+ supports real-time analysis of billions of records and fast access to terabytes of historical data. It also: •provides seamless scalability; •runs on industry standard server platforms; •is top-ranked in third-party benchmark testing; •has an extremely small footprint, which makes installation and maintenance fast and straightforward; •easily accommodates available APIs for connectivity to major external systems and modules; •requires fewer developers, contributing to lower total cost of ownership.

The result? A rich environment of powerful solutions. Kx: The world’s most powerful number cruncher.

Kx technology is widely adopted by financial institutions around the world, including the top ten global investment banks. Many large users employ kdb+ as the enterprise-wide database for financial data sets such as market data. Utility, oil and gas, pharmaceutical, Internet, and software companies, as well as academic researchers, use kdb+ when they need a high-speed database with exceptional built-in analytic capabilities.

Kdb+ is a time series database optimized for Big Data analytics. The columnar design of kdb+ means it offers greater speed and efficiency than typical relational databases. Its native support for time-series operations vastly improves both the speed and performance of queries, aggregation and analysis of structured data.

Kdb+ is also different from other popular databases because it has a built in proprietary array language, q. This means that it operates directly on the data in the database, removing the need to ship data to other applications for analysis. Kdb+ and q make full use of the intrinsic power of modern multi core hardware architectures.

The design of kdb+ allows it to scale easily as data volumes grow, without losing performance. It is built on the shoulders of a programming paradigm developed at IBM in the 1960s, which Kx has improved upon over many iterations in subsequent years.
Trading firms and financial institutions have used Kx technology for lightning fast processing of vast amounts of data for over two decades, before the phrase "Big Data" was even coined. Other sectors outside of finance, including the utility, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, and business intelligence software industries, are increasingly adopting kdb+ to solve their Big Data problems.

For many businesses, the promise of Big Data analytics is the ability to use both streaming and the vast amounts of historical data effectively. This includes data that will accumulate over future years, as well as data a business may already have warehoused but never been able to use.

The means by which a database uses data storage, both in-memory and on-disk, can make a tremendous difference in the speed and cost in Big Data analytics. One feature that really sets kdb+ apart is its ability to combine streaming, in-memory and historical data in real-time analytics, then place the results in their full historical context.

Kdb+'s exceptional speed in analysing data, wherever it is stored, enables businesses to visualize its complexities in ways they found impossible before.
Companies choosing Big Data software need to consider the type and volumes of data they have, as well as what type of analytics they will be doing. They also have to factor in the cost of the hardware and the people required to run their systems. Finally, it is important that the software is robust and can support future growth, so that it doesn't become outdated quickly.

Our customers tell us that the total cost of kdb+ is lower than that of its competitors for a number of reasons. One is because of the small investment in computing resources required to operate it. Comparisons show kdb+ requires 10 to 50 times less computing infrastructure.

Also, kdb+ developers have been found to be at least five times more productive than developers working with traditional database technologies. It is well-suited to the use of commodity hardware and storage devices in any topology, local or distributed, providing flexible and cost-effective ways to add capacity when required.
