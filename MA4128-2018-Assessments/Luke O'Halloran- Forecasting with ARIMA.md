Forecasting with ARIMA in R.
==================





## Objectives
The reader can expect to learn how to:

* Plot, examine, and prepare series for modeling
* Extract the seasonality component from the time series
* Test for stationarity and apply appropriate transformations
* Choose the order of an ARIMA model
* Forecast the series


## Method
#### 1.Examine your data and plot
* Plot the data and examine its patterns and irregularities
* Clean up any outliers or missing values if needed
* `tsclean()` is a convenient method for outlier removal and inputing missing values
* Take a logarithm of a series to help stabilize a strong growth trend
#### 2.Decompose your data.¨
* Does the series appear to have trends or seasonality?
* Use `decompose()` or `stl()` to examine and possibly remove components of the series
#### 3.Stationarity
* Is the series stationary?
* Use `adf.test()`, ACF, PACF plots to determine order of differencing needed
#### 4.Autocorrelations and choosing model order
* Choose order of the ARIMA by examining ACF and PACF plots
#### 5.Fit an ARIMA model
#### 6.Evaluate and iterate
* Check residuals, which should haven no patterns and be normally distributed
* If there are visible patterns or bias, plot ACF/PACF. Are any additional order parameters needed?
* Refit model if needed. Compare model errors and fit criteria such as AIC or BIC.
* Calculate forecast using the chosen model

## Example 
* The data used in this example is U.S. airlines: monthly aircraft miles flown (Millions) 1963 -1970.
* We will remove one year of the original series. Preform our analysis on the reduced data, then forecast using the selected model. 
* We will then compare our forecast to the actual data.
#### Load data set in R.
```
install.packages("TSA")
library(TSA)
setwd("/Users/lukeohalloran/Desktop/TimeSeries")
airline <- read.csv("us-airlines-monthly-aircraft-mil.csv",header = T)
plot(airline1)
#original data
xold<- ts(airline1$U.S..airlines..monthly.aircraft.miles.flown..Millions..1963..1970, freq=12, start = c(1963,1), end = c(1970,12))
#1 year removed
xnew<- ts(airline$U.S..airlines..monthly.aircraft.miles.flown..Millions..1963..1970, freq=12, start = c(1963,1), end = c(1969,12))
plot(xnew)
plot(xold, ylab="Miles Flown")
```

##### Decompose the data and Seasonally differencing.
Decomposing a time series means separating it into it’s constituent components. 
These components are as follows:
* Seasonal: Patterns that repeat with a fixed period of time. We see this in our data with a seasonality of 1 year.
* Trend: The underlying trend. We see this in our series as the number of miles flown grows each year.
* Random: This is the residuals of the original time series after the seasonal and trend series are removed.
The Box-Cox tells us if we should log transform our series. In this exampla the Box-Cox supports logging the data.
```
####Decompose data
decom <- decompose(xnew) 
### Box-Cox 
BC <-BoxCox.ar(xnew, lambda=seq(-2,2,0.1) ) 
#seasonally differencing
xlog <- log(xnew)
seasondiff<-diff(xlog,lag=12,diff=1)
plot(diff(xlog))
acf(seasondiff, lag.max = 40)
```

#### Test Stationarity
Fitting an ARIMA model requires the series to be stationary. A series is said to be stationary when its mean, variance, and autocovariance are time invariant.
The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a formal statistical test for stationarity. The null hypothesis assumes that the series is non-stationary. The ADF procedure tests whether the change in Y can be explained by a lagged value and a linear trend. If contribution of the lagged value to the change in Y is non-significant and there is a presence of a trend component, the series is non-stationary and null hypothesis will not be rejected.
```
#dickey fuller
adf.test(seasondiff)
#difference the data
diffseasondiff <- diff(seasondiff)
adf.test(diffseasondiff)
plot(diffseasondiff, ylab= "Logged Stationary Series")
```

* We now have a stationary series after seasonally differencing to remove the seasonal trend. 
* And diffrencing to remove the upward trend.

#### Picking model using acf, pacf and eacf.
Now that we know our series is stationary we can select a model to forecast our series. First we will use the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) to see if an AR(p) model or a MA(q) would be adequate. 
The Extended Autocorrelation Function (EACF) method can tentatively identify the orders of a stationary or non-stationary ARMA process based on iterated least squares estimates of the autoregressive parameters. 
The eacf suggests using ARIMA(0,2). This supports the MA(2) model selected using the acf.
Looking at the acf, it decays suggesting an AR model. The pacf suggests  AR(2) or maybe an AR(4). Looking at the Acf also suggests trying an MA(2).
```
#acf, pacf and eacf
acf(diffseasondiff, main= "acf", lag.max = 50)
pacf(diffseasondiff, main= "pacf", lag.max = 50)
eacf(diffseasondiff)
```

#### Model fitting using residuals
The steps in analysing the residuals are as follows:
* Normality can be checked using a histogram, Q-Q plot and the Shapiro-Wilk test.
* Constant variance can be checked by plotting the fitted values, against the residuals. From this plot we would expect a random scatter of points with no obvious pattern.
* A time plot of the residuals should contain no trend (e.g., linear, quadratic, seasonal) if we have adequately modelled the series. If any trends are observed, then we should go back to our model selection step.
* There should be no significant autocorrelations in the ACF for the residuals if these are white noise.

```
model <- arima(xlog, order=c(0,1,2), seasonal = list(order=c(0,1,1), period=12))
model
resid <- rstandard(model)
fit <- fitted(model)
dev.new(width=8, height=4)
hist(resid, main="Histogram of Residuals", xlab="Residuals")
qqnorm(resid, main="Normal Q-Q Plot of Residuals"); qqline(resid);
shapiro.test(resid)

plot(as.vector(fit), as.vector(resid), main="Fitted Versus Residuals",
     xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals" )
plot(resid, main="Residuals", ylab="Residuals", type="o")
acf(resid, main="ACF of Residuals")
runs(resid)
dev.new(width=7, height=7)
tsdiag(model)
```

###### Results
*  AIC is -171.9, which was the best AIC of models tested.
* As you can see from the figures \ref{fig:hist4} and \ref{fig:qq4}, the histogram is slightly skewed and the points in the QQ-plot follow the line except for at either end of the line.
* The Shapiro Wilks test give a p-value of 4.251e-06. I cannot accept the null hypothesis that the model is normally distributed.
* The resulting p-values are all above 0.05 which supports the hypothesis that the residuals are white noise. Note that the runs test of independence `(runs(resid))` leads to a p-value of 0.137 which also supports the hypothesis that the residuals are white noise.
#### Forecasting the selected model.
The final step of the project is to forecast the next 12 observations and compare it to the actual data, since the data set used throughout testing was only 87.5% of the actual series. Comparing the predicted values to the actual values we observe the model seems to be a good fit. 
```
forecast <- plot(model,n.ahead=12,type="l", col='red', ylab = "Miles Flown")              
lines(xoldlog, col="blue") 
```
