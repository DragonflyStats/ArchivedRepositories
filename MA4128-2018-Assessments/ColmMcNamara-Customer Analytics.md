## What is Customer Analytics?
Customer analytics refers to the processes and technologies that give organizations the customer insight necessary to deliver offers that are anticipated, relevant and timely. This allows companies to make decisions based on the wants of the customer which will in turn help to maximise profits. Customer analysis is seen as one of the most important aspects of marketing. Customer analytics comprises techniques such as predictive modeling, data visualization, information management and segmentation. 

## The Importance of Customer Analytics
Marketers have long been aware of the importance of consumer orientation, for achieving marketing objectives largely hinges on knowing, serving and influencing consumers. As such companies have always taken action to understand their consumer base by interviewing, fielding questionnaires and analyzing secondary materials, at the end of the day, the information companies gain through research helps them develop their products and services. Customer analysis is vital to any effective business strategy. If a business doesn't know who its customers are or what its customers want, it can't meet customers' needs. A customer analysis will do three main things:

* Identify the target customer
* Understand the needs of the customer
* Show how the company's product or service meets the customers' needs or wants

Customers are more empowered and connected than ever. And becoming more so. Customers have access to information anywhere, any time – where to shop, what to buy, how much to pay, etc. That makes it increasingly important to predict how customers will behave when interacting with your organization, so you can respond accordingly. The deeper your understanding of customers' buying habits and lifestyle preferences, the more accurate your predictions of future buying behaviors will be – and the more successful you will be at delivering relevant offers that attract rather than alienate customers.

## Methods Of Customer Analytics
There are a steps to take when carrying out customer analytics, these allow for an accurate result to be taken. 

### Who are the customers?
You can learn more about your customers in a variety of ways, and a mix of research methods will give you the most accurate results. It is best to gather as much information as possible, and to not fall into thinking details are irrelevant. Details like age, gender, location, demographics and psychographics are all important, but so are their interests, other brands they like, publications they read and so on.

Talking to them and running a survey will be the best way of hearing about them in their own words, although that does come with biases. Reduce this by complementing that research with sales data, CRM data, and speaking to customer-facing employees. Once you have identified these groups, social data can elaborate your understanding by providing a more holistic view of the groups.

### Segment these groups
* Measurable: Your analysis should identify the size of a market segment so that you can decide to what extent efforts should be focused on the segment
* Distinguishable: Observable differences that are clearly defined must exist in order to characterize segments
* Substantial: The market needs to be large enough to justify segmenting, with each segment substantial enough to make it worthwhile
* Financial: There will be additional costs when marketing to multiple, separate groups, so the predicted income must exceed these costs
* Accessible: Your marketing messages should be accessible to each market segment. Different groups will respond better to different forms of advertising

### Develop customer profiles
Take your data, your segmentation criteria, some educated guesswork, and develop some buyer personas. It helps to have personas so you can visualize a human rather than aiming for an abstract idea.

#### Elements to include in a buyer persona include:

* Background and responsibilities: including job title, career path, and their primary job responsibilities
* Demographics: gender, age, income, family, and location
* Communication: which channels do they prefer? What is their demeanor? Do they have an assistant?
* Media and influencers: which publications do they follow, and which individuals are leading the conversation in their world?
* Challenges vs proposition: The challenges they face in implementing their primary job goals and how your product or service can help them overcome those issues
* Objections: common reasons why this persona wouldn’t choose your product
* Common language: what language should you use to appeal to their needs?
* Quotes: adding some qualitative data in the form of quotes can really help to bring the personas to life and remind you there are real people behind these aggregated models

### Discover their needs
The next step in customer analysis is to get a good idea of what the customer’s needs are. By understanding their needs, several departments can gear their output towards answering these questions, rather than taking an “If you build it, they will come” approach.

### How does your brand meet the needs of the customer?
Once you’ve done your research and outlined your different customer groups and their needs, you should connect the dots to your brand and identify how you meet those needs. This section of customer analysis should just be a matter of discussing and brainstorming with internal partners.

Solution based answers should come out of this process. Rather than saying, “we have these features”, you should be focusing on how those features deliver solutions to the problems faced by your customers and prospects.

Solving the problems that customers face on a daily basis will resonate with them much better than shouting about a shiny new feature. Focus on how you can make their lives easier and more enjoyable.

This will obviously be reflected in marketing, but these insights can help sales and product development as well, tightening your focus to better match your customer’s needs.


## Example of Customer Analytics

In the example above we see that Athletico Madrid are after reaching the Champions League Final. The final is set to be played in Milan. An airline company for example Aer Lingus has a number of flights running from Liverpool to Milan with free seats. In an attempt to entice Liverpool fans into travelling to the match the airline offer a package deal. This deal included the seats that would have been empty and a hotel room. The idea of this is to try and get individuals who would not normally go to the match to now travel as they think it is a good deal.

## Conclusion
After my studying of the topic of customer analysis I have learned that it is an essential part or marketing in day to day business. The concept of customer analysis is to set about the marketing of the product/service by analysing what the customer wants and changing the marketing plan to suit the interests of the customer. By giving customers what they want companies are able to improve profit margins. For this reason it is important that customer analysis is carried out by all companies.
