## *Brief History of IoT*
In 1832 An electromagnetic telegraph was created by Baron Schilling in Russia and in 1833 Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber invented their own code to communicate over a distance of 1200 m within Göttingen, Germany. 1892 Nikola Tesla created a basic design for radio and in 1898 he patented a wireless radio-controlled robot-boat which was the first of its kind at the time, in 1926 Nikola Tesla had an interview with Colliers magazine. 1974 was the beginning of TCP/IP. 1982 A modified Coke machine became the first internet-connected appliance. 1990 was the year the first IoT device was considered, John Romkey created a toaster that could be turned on and off over the Internet for the October ’89 INTEROP conference. Dan Lynch, President of Interop, promised Romkey that, if Romkey was able to “bring up his toaster on the Net,” the appliance would be given star placement in the floor-wide exhibitors at the conference. The toaster was connected to a computer with TCP/IP networking. 1999 was a big year for the IoT as ‘The Internet of Things’ term is coined by Kevin Ashton executive director of the Auto-ID Centre. 2000 LG announces its first Internet refrigerator plans. 2003-2004 the term “Internet of Things” is mentioned in main-stream publications like The Guardian, Scientific American and the Boston Globe. 2005 the IoT hit another level when the UN’s International Telecommunications Union ITU published its first report on the topic. 2006-2008 Recognition by the EU, and the First European IOT conference is held. 2011 Nest self-learning Wi-Fi-enabled thermostat Cisco, IBM, Ericsson produce large educational and marketing initiatives on the topic. 2011-2017 Low-power chipsets with built-in Wi-Fi and 3G/4G connectivity are smaller, more powerful, and cheaper to produce. IoT is becoming more and more widely used in many industries and home owners.
## *Definition of IoT*
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifies and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

## *Potential of the IoT*
The Internet of Things sensors and actuators connected by networks to computing systems has received enormous attention over the past five years. According to McKinsey Global Institute (& Company) the potential for Internet of Things is: 

> “To get a broader view of the IoT’s potential benefits and challenges across the global economy, we analysed more than 150 use cases, ranging from people whose devices monitor health and wellness to manufacturers that utilize sensors to optimize the maintenance of equipment and protect the safety of workers. Our bottom-up analysis for the applications we size estimates that the IoT has a total potential economic impact of $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the top end, that level of value —including the consumer surplus—would be equivalent to about 11 percent of the world economy (exhibit)”
