__Kitman Labs Research: Is less more?__ 
===========================

## Need for the Research
Sport Science is an industry that has adopted a ‘less is more’ mindset over the last 5-10 years, something that is creating a stigma within the industry and might even be creating more problems than it’s solving.
It may sound like a big statement, but numerous times we see sport scientists telling coaches that an athlete should do less today or even nothing because their risk of injury is increased? Kitman Labs found that this is a very frequent conversation and unfortunately puts the sports scientist in role of the grim reaper. In an honest effort to keep the team healthy, they are the ones who arrive to the coaches office trying to put the brakes on athletes.

## Effect of isolated Research
Many teams are inundated with data and they don’t really know what to do with it or how to use it. Isolated research studies showcase the value of specific data points or calculations which then get adopted across the industry widely. For example, let’s imagine a study in professional football that showcased when athletes increased their weekly running distance by over 25%, that injury risk increased by 50%. Other teams would then naturally use these findings to drive decisions about athlete running distances, likely resulting in halting athletes topping that 25% increase week on week. This seems like a perfectly logical step to take and practitioners would assume they would have a positive effect on player health.


## Kitman Labs' Research Findings
The problem, however, is that every team is not the same, every athlete is not the same. Therefore, doing less or avoiding increases can result in more injuries than they stop. Athletes are expected to do incredible things and perform at levels that push the boundaries of human performance. Well to do this, coaches need to create overload, they have to push athletes to get fitter, faster and stronger. They have to push them to be fit enough to cope with the ever increasing demands of the game. These advances in performance that are craved and desired require, effort, hard work and huge amounts of work! Kitman Labs research has shown time and time again that in many scenarios for many teams that there is far less risk for athletes by increasing their load and volume of work than there is from doing less.

Kitman Labs are seeing evidence that deconditioning may occur far quicker than we actually think which creates a knock-on impact of athletes breaking more frequently due to a reduction in stimulus. Kitman Labs released a series of insights providing examples that highlight the importance of maintain high levels of stimulus for both the volume of work athletes participate in and the intensity of the work they do without increasing health risk. The old adage of train hard, play hard, holds true even in 2018.

## Evidence found by Kitman Labs in various Sports:

## Academic Research supporting Kitman Labs' findings
* Karara (2017) found that several data analytics, pilot programs using  Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and wearable technology can provide data metrics on player’s performance as well as help in proactive injury prediction. 
* Kiesel, Plishy and Voight (2007) found that fundamental movement (as measured by the FMS™) is an identifiable risk factor for injury in professional football players. The findings of this study suggest professional football players with dysfunctional fundamental movement patterns as measured by the FMS™ are more likely to suffer an injury than those scoring higher on the FMS™. Therefore, by testing players FMS pre-season, coaches can identify players at risk of injury that season.
