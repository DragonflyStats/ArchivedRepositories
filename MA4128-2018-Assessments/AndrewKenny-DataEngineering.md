BACKROUND

Data engineers are the plumbers building a data pipeline, while data scientists are the painters and storytellers giving meaning to an otherwise static entity. Simply put, data engineers clean, prepare and optimize data for consumption.

Data engineering is inherently a multidisciplinary field, because of the number of technologies involved: visualization, data analysis, knowledge engineering, perhaps databases, and courses the subject matter of the application. (Sumathi and Sivanandam 2006)

Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis (DataScience 2018). For all the work that data scientists do to answer questions using large sets of information, there have to be mechanisms for collecting and validating that information (DataScience 2018). In order for that work to ultimately have any value, there also have to be mechanisms for applying it to real-world operations in some way (DataScience 2018). Those are both engineering tasks: the application of science to practical, functioning systems (DataScience 2018).

Data engineers focus on the applications and harvesting of big data. Their role doesn’t include a great deal of analysis or experimental design (DataScience 2018). Instead, they are out where the rubber meets the road (literally, in the case of self-driving vehicles), creating interfaces and mechanisms for the flow and access of information (DataScience 2018). They may be experts in:

1. System architecture
2. Programming
3. Database design and configuration
4. Interface and sensor configuration

FUTURE OF DATA ENGINEERING

The future of data engineering is quite abstracted. Throughout most of modern history and our use of databases, data has been viewed on a source-by-source basis — customer purchases from one database, check-ins from another, etc. All of the work that data scientists and engineers do pre-analysis is unique from source to source. The value in the data pipeline is typically finished and created at the end of it. Everything needs to be set up properly and in a scalable way, but a product is going to rely on the actual models or insights created by systems. Value is created by outputs, yet Data Scientists are spending tons of time splitting columns. 

Abstracting data from its source enables a new way of thinking. Thinking about data as it actually is and not as the form it comes in. Thinking about how to focus on the important parts of making great data-driven products and forgetting about the tedious manual work. Thinking about how we can enable the next generation of data-driven builders.

Trends in company KPIs (key perfomance indicators) show that the ability to respond quickly to events such as customer requests, changing market priorities, or new competitors is critical to continued success. Companies must respond at a constantly accelerating rate, so speed will affect the entire organization, from its business models to its organizational structures.(J.Bosch, 2016)

With storage costs falling to zero and virtually every product's connectivity exploding, collecting data from products in the field, customers' and other sources is a reality that's still unfolding. However, the challenge isn't the big data but the organization's ability to make smart, timely decisions based on the data. Although many companies still rely on their managers' opinions, future organizations will increasingly use data to inform decision making. So, data collection, data analysis, and decision making based on that data will strongly affect companies' functions, architecture, and ways of working.
