###Tableau Functions

**Hold Large Amounts of Data**: Tableau can hold large amounts of data, whether it’s structured or unstructured, petabytes or terabytes, millions or billions of rows, you can turn big data into big ideas. One can connect directly to local and cloud data sources, or import data for fast in-memory performance. Tableau aim to help people make sense of big data with easy-to-understand visuals and interactive web dashboards.

**Time Series Analysis**: Time is relevant to almost every analysis.Tableau’s built-in date and time functions let you drag and drop to analyze time trends; drill into days, hours and seconds with a click; analyze time by day of week; and easily perform time comparisons like year-over-year growth and moving averages.

**Data Visualisation**: A picture is worth a million rows. Data visualization with Tableau makes insights come alive with impact and communicates complex ideas simply. Expressive visualization enables you to get beyond static charts to create multi-faceted views of data and explore every dimension. Tableau becomes a natural extension of your thought process, making it drag-and-drop easy to uncover hidden opportunities.

**Business Dashboards**: Tableau allows even non-technical users to create interactive, real-time visualizations in minutes. In just a few clicks, they can combine data sources, add filters, and drill down into specific information. Sharing a dashboard requires no programming, whether it’s on Tableau Server, Tableau Online, or any portal or web page.


###Computer Graphics

Pat Hanrahan was also a founding member of **Pixar** in the 1980s. This project transformed the world of animated film. Hanrahan has received three Academy Awards for his work in computer graphics. He was awarded in 2014 a Technical Achievement Oscar for his formalisation and reference implementation of the concepts behind physically based rendering, as shared in their book Physically Based Rendering. In 2004, Hanrahan was awarded another Technical Achievement Oscar, together with Stephen R. Marschner and Henrik Wann Jensen, for pioneering research in simulating subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials as presented in their paper "A Practical Model for Subsurface Light Transport.". Nearly a decade earlier, Hanrahan and other Pixar founding employees were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Oscar, for development of "RenderMan" software providing the means to digitally create scenes or elements that may be composited with other footage.


###Tableau and Business

Tableau is business intelligence (BI) software that allows anyone to easily connect to data, then visualize and create interactive dashboards that they can securely share online with others in a matter of seconds. It's so simple to use that Tableau themselves claim that any Excel user can learn it, but powerful enough to solve even the most complex analytical problems. 

Tableau also claim to be a much more efficient, scalable and easily deployable business intelligence tool than others. They emphasize this as they believe it is what today's organisations need in order to accomplish their goals. Often introducing a new BI tool is an effort of weeks, months or even years and maintenance is neverending. Installing Tableau Desktop only takes minutes and once it's installed, anyone can connect to big data with a click and create interactive, analytical dashboards. Sharing dashboards is just as easy. 

Many different business sectors use tableau as an analytics software so as to display large amounts of data, for example, the banking sector. Financial institutions use Tableau to gain insights that help them improve service, discover new opportunities and stand out from the competition. Focus in on what matters at any moment using dynamic reports with live data. Cross-portfolio visibility helps you identify trends and risks and find relationships inside your business. Barclays is one bank that uses Tableau software. Many pharmaceutical companies also use Tableau software, such as Allergan. The pharmaceutucal industry combines billion-dollar bets, cutting-edge science and global impact so is obviously an industry of major importance. At major pharma companies around the world, Tableau supports data-driven action from the laba to the boardroom. Researchers use it to control the quality of experiments. Decision-makers choose where to invest based on the freshest information. And marketers get a clear picture of results across physicians, prescriptions, sales, and geography.


###The Future of Tableau

According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) by 2020 the world will generate 50 times the amount of data as it did in 2011. And will have 75 times the number of information sources. Tableau believes this is a huge opportunity for human advancement but for this data to offer benefits humans must have it at their fingertips. Tableau is building software to deliver exactly that. They make analyzing data fast, easy and useful.
