## Definition of Data Engineering
From helping cars drive themselves to helping Facebook tag you in photos, data science has attracted a lot of buzz recently. Data scientists have become extremely sought after, and for good reason a skilled data scientist can add incredible value to a business. Data scientists and engineers help power self-driving cars.
But a data scientist is only as good as the data they have access to. Most companies store their data in variety of formats across databases and text files. This is where data engineers come in they build pipelines that transform that data into formats that data scientists can use. Data engineers are just as important as data scientists but tend to be less visible because they tend to be further from the end product of the analysis.
## Data Engineering Skills
A data engineer needs to be good at the following:

•	Architecting distributed systems

•	Creating reliable pipelines

•	Combining data sources

•	Architecting data stores

•	Collaborating with data science teams and building the right solutions for the
## Data Engineering roles 

Although data engineers need to have the skills listed above, the day to day of a data engineer will vary depending on the type of company they work for. Broadly, you can classify data engineers into a few categories:

•	Generalist

•	Pipeline-centric

•	Database-centric

## Overlap Between Data engineering and Data science
There is great deal of overlap between data engineering and data science. For instance, a data scientist might use the Hadoop ecosystem to serve up answers to their data questions, and a data engineer might be programming an iterative machine learning algorithm to run over a Spark cluster. Even though these tracks are separate in our program, some companies prefer that candidates are comfortable with aspects from both data science and data engineering. Additionally, if a company has defined these two roles separately, it can be possible to switch from one role to the other.

## The data engineering ecosystem in 2017
According to ‘insight’ the data engineering ecosystem in 2017 was:
> Since Insight launched the Insight Data Engineering Fellows program in 2014, they’ve built relationships with over 75 teams in the data industry. They’ve discussed the latest challenges faced by engineers on top teams like Facebook, Airbnb, Slack, The New York Times, LinkedIn, Amazon, and Tesla. Additionally, insights ever-growing alumni network now includes engineers and 750+ data scientists that regularly share their experience with the Insight community. Thanks to this strong community, they have a unique position to detect emerging patterns in the technologies used in the field.
they’re constantly exploring ways to contribute this knowledge to the next generation of data engineers and the broader data community. They’ve developed a more interactive version of their Data Engineering Ecosystem Map. This iteration provides a streamlined view of the core components of data pipelines, while enabling deeper exploration of the complex world of distributed system technologies.
