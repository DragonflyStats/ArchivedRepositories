CFA EXAMS
======================================

It’s notoriously difficult – only one candidate in every five signing up will complete the programme. It’s not cheap – it will set you back more than $1,000 (€743) for each of the three exams, and more if you have to repeat. And it takes at least four years to complete.[1]

These are some of the facts about the Chartered Financial Analyst,launched in the US in 1963, the CFA has slowly come to prominence as one of the world’s most respected and recognised investment qualifications. It first came to Ireland in 2000, and since then hundreds of candidates have embarked on the course, a mixture of academic theory, current industry practice and ethical and professional standards, all in the quest of joining more than 100,000 charterholders worldwide.  

**Why become CFA qualified?**  
The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®) Program helps you capitalize on your strengths, supercharging your education and work experience into a charter that will tell the world you have the skills necessary to compete and excel in today’s complex and evolving investment industry.The CFA charter is the gold standard for the investment industry. Charterholders enjoy a mark of distinction
throughout the world.  
The CFA Program provides the strongest foundation in advanced investment, analysis, and real-world portfolio management skills for a career advantage that you will use at all stages of your career. This globally recognized, graduate-level credential is held by over 150,000 professionals across 163 countries.

**Job Titles**  
1) Portfolio Manager  
2) Research Analyst  
3) Chief Level Executive  
4) Consultant  
5) Risk Manager  

**How to become qualified?**  
There are three leveles of the CFA program exam,these focus areas vary by exam level, increasing in complexity and difficulty with a core of ethics and professional standards across all levels.
To enroll in the CFA Program and register for your first Level I exam, you must have an international travel passport and one of the following:  
1. Undergraduate education: A bachelor’s (or equivalent) degree or be in the final year of your bachelor’s degree program.  
2. Work experience: Four years of professional work experience (does not have to be investment related).  
3. A combination of professional work experience and education that totals at least four years (part-time positions do not qualify, and the four-year total must be accrued prior to enrollment).

However entry into the course is no grantee of completition designed as a self-study course, the CFA programme, which consists of three levels covering topics such as ethics, financial accounting and reporting, equity investments and derivatives, is estimated to take 1,000 hours of study to complete.




**Opportunity cost**  
There is an opportunity cost associated with taking a year or two out of paid employment to complete an MBA. A CFA, on the other hand, can give you the prestige of a qualification but at a much lower cost and allow you to remain in your day job.

And the difficulty – and specific nature perhaps – of a CFA makes it more exclusive: about a million people globally claim to hold an MBA, compared with a little over 100,000 CFA holders.However, for all its relative strengths, it’s unlikely that, as the Financial Times recently proclaimed, the CFA will rival the broad reach of the MBA anytime soon.

**Conclusion**  
So while being costly for a non-essential professional exam, it may prove being worthwhile to undertake as given the increase in job competition amoung graduates, this exam may prove the difference between a career and disappiontment. And while it is not currently required for jobs this may one day change and become as recognised as the chartered accounting exams. I also found that while on placement that many companies will actually offer to cover the cost of the exam and also allow study leave as they will recieve a more qualified employee, this shows there is an obvious trust in the qualification if companies are willing to undertake such risks.
