Focused on financial institutions that work cross-asset, often with multi-system and/or high volume trading activities, the Company scopes, designs, develops, implements and supports a broad range of mission critical data and trading systems across front, middle and back office operations. The Company’s software is also used in a range of industries including telecoms, digital marketing, pharma and utilities to help organisations solve their most demanding data management and analytics challenges.

## Foundation
Incorporated in 1996, FD has served the capital markets industry since its incorporation. The Company holds a niche market position in terms of domain knowledge of capital market asset classes (equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, etc), as well as expertise in leading financial services systems (such as Calypso, Murex, Opics, Summit, Principia, Opus, Wall Street, kdb+, etc). 

The Company continues to work closely with leading global financial institutions to enable client proprietary and 3rd Party systems cope with the demands of high volume, complex trading in an increasingly regulated market. This combination of domain knowledge and technical expertise in leading financial services technologies has motivated the Company to invest in developing its own product suite.

## Public
First Derivatives is a publicly held company, trading on the London Stock Exchange (LSE FDP.L) and Irish Stock Exchange (IEX:FDP.I). The Company is headquartered in Newry, Northern Ireland from where it has established its research and development centre, its Capital Markets Competency Centre and its near-shore support facilities. The Company has continued to expand its service offering and now has operational bases in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia to service its global client base. It is recognized as one of the fastest growing capital markets service providers in the world. FD now employs over 2,000 employees worldwide.

FD’s distinct competitive advantage derives from its unique combination of knowledge of financial markets and expertise in financial services technologies. The Company believes that its consultants need to fully understand the client’s business requirements in order to produce the right technical solution. This saves clients development time, and ultimately money.

We are widely renowned for the quality of our service and our product portfolio and for our pragmatic and commercial approach. Our growth is the direct result of the importance we attach to our clients, understanding their businesses and building and maintaining strong relationships.

## Ireland
The firm has its HQ in Newry in Northern Ireland. This lands it in good stead to tackle Brexit. FD has bases in Dublin, Belfast, Newry and across the globe. It is also a fast paced organisation employing almost "400 graduates by Novemeber 2017 making it one of the biggest graduate recruiters in Ireland" (Gleeson, 2017). First Derivatives is interested in hiring "anyone with a good mathematical background". (Gleeson, 2017)
