#### *_Background and Projections_*

The Internet of Things is a topic that has attracted significant attention since the idea was first brought about in 2014. Much analysis has been conducted in this area, with some predicting that there will be over 50 billion devices connected to the internet by the year 2020 creating a significant platform by which to operate and implement such an open for the Internet of Things

#### *_Definitions_*

The international Telecommunications Union has described the Internet of Things (IoT)as:

>>> “a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies. Through the exploitation of identification, data capture, processing and communication capabilities, the IoT makes full use of things to offer services to all kinds of applications, whilst ensuring that security and privacy requirements are fulfilled.”

The IoT put simply refers to a state by which objects, peoples animals etc are embedded with microprocessors which are connected to the internet via wireless connection. IoT applications generate data collected from various domains and sectors which provide useful insights into the environments and applications that generate it.

#### *_Potential of IoT in Manufacturing_*

An area which has been observed as an area which the IoT can return great dividends is in manufacturing.  The manufacturing industry is the biggest industry in the globe, and is currently leading the charge in the Internet of Things with the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies and methodologies. The move towards increased efficiency, automation, customer focus and competitive advantage have formed the bases of Industry 4.0. This move however will require the development of advanced machine learning programmes and predictive models to cope with the large volumes of data arriving for processing because of this new industrial approach. This is where the internet of things will increase the efficiency of analysing this data.

In manufacturing processes and facilities where we are converting raw materials into physical products, there is a vast amount of data involved in this conversion from machine to machine process time, buffer to buffer hold/capacity, station to station JIT delivery etc. This process displays the high interconnectivity of between cells and stations in the manufacturing line which is currently completed by manual communication between line operators and staff. IoT and Industry 4.0 practices aim to eliminate this slow communication method which can easily be misinterpreted and lost in transit to a system whereby this data as available at all times for all levels of the organisation to make informed decisions about the manufacturing / production process. 

#### *_Benefits of IoT in Manufacturing_*

The IoT in such a situation can benefit the manufacturing system in a number of different ways:
1.	Increase Optimisation
2.	Increase Digitation
3.	Increase Factory Visualisation
4.	Better Supplier/Customer Relations
5.	Trace and Trace technology improvements
6.	Facility Management Cost Reductions 
7.	Better Quality control with few defects, shorter lead times, reduced rework and muda
8.	Increased Communication
9.	Better and Faster Decision Making at all levels of the organisation due to the availability of accurate and precise manufacturing and customer related data
