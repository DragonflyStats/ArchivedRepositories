#### *_What is Supply Chain Management_*

Supply chain management (SCM) is a process that engages all events dealing with the flow and conversion of raw materials to finished goods and services for consumption by consumers (Kotzab, et al., 2005). Supply chain management also engages the complete flow of information from initial order placement of raw materials through to end of life (Kotzab, et al., 2005). The overarching aim of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as described in Handfield & Nichols Book Introduction to Supply Chain Management in 1999 as (Handfield & Nichols, 1999):

>“The integration of such activities these activities through improved supply relationships, to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage."

The Supply Chain Resource Cooperative, a leading research think tank in North Caroline have completed numerous projects and industrial investigations in the area of supply chain management and redesign with huge MNC`s including Lenovo, Duke Energy, Biogen and the Ministry of health leading to huge saving and waste reductions in the overall supply chain (Supply Chain Resource Cooperative (SCRC), 2017). There definition of this field of study described Supply Chain management as:

>“the active management of supply chain activities to maximize customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. It represents a conscious effort by the supply chain firms to develop and run supply chains in the most effective & efficient ways possible. Supply chain activities cover everything from product development, sourcing, production, and logistics, as well as the information systems needed to coordinate these activities.”

There are three main aspects of supply chain management as identified by Seuring in 2001:
1. Focus on the marketplace and customer positioning in which all activities must add value to the betterment of the product or service for each customer
2. Integration of all every part of the supply chain must be considered and interlinked to ensure an effective solution is produced
3. Efficiency features and characteristics for a central component of optimizing the entire supply chain.

#### *_History of Supply Chain Management_*

The idea and expression supply chain management has emerged over the last 20 years since the council of logistics Management in 1995 in which the term supply chain was introduced (Mentzer, et al., 2001). However, the idea of Supply Chain Management was proposed by Keith Oliver in 1982 expanding on the premise of the assembly lines of the early 20th century.

In subsequent years, Supply Chain become central to operations management and research with a renewed focus on detailing and analysing each and every aspect of the manufacturing process from front end activities including sourcing and planning of resources, materials etc. direct manufacturing activities and final back end activities including customer returns, shipping, and disposal at end of life.

#### *_Supply Chain Management SCOR Model_*

Supply Chain Operations Reference Model Provides a unique framework that links performance metrics, process, best practices and people into a unified structure. It supports communication between supply chain partners and enhances the effectiveness of SC Management, technology and related SC Improvements

Benefits of SCOR Model

1.	Rapid Assessment of SC Performance
2.	Identification of Performance Gaps
3.	Efficient SC Network redesign and Optimization
4.	Enhanced operation Control from STD Core processes
5.	Streamlined Management Reporting and Org. Structure
6.	Alignment of SC Team Skills with Strategic Obj.
7.	Detailed game plan new product and business launch
8.	Systematic SC Mergers that capture Projected Savings

SCOR helps solve 5 Key Challenges

1.	Customer Service: Provides a framework for measuring & understanding current SC Conditions and performance to create a foundation for improvement. Helps managers evaluate cost, development of strategies for meeting new and existing customers expectations and responses to market growth 

2.	Cost control: SC under pressure from rising freight prices, labour costs, commodity process, new regulatory demands etc. The SCOR Metrics provide a base as to how successful the organisation is currently and meeting its desired objectives in relation to this subject

3.	Planning and Risk Management: SCOR Model in this respect leads to faster implementation, more comprehensive identification of potential risks and easier coordination of customers, suppliers etc.

4.	Supplier/Partner Relationship Management: Provides a common language for SC Classification and analysis. Allows for easier communication, speeds benchmarking efforts/enhances best practices

5.	Talent: SCOR Skills management framework complements process reference, metrics reference and practice reference components with baseline skills, experience, aptitudes and training.

Operations and Supply Chain Processes can be categorized into the views of the producer of the products and services as planning, sourcing making delivering and returning. Shown below depicts where the processes are used in different parts of the supply chain.

1.	Planning: consists of the processes needed to operate an existing supply chain strategically, Anticipates demand will be met with avail. Resources, develops metrics to monitor the supply chain so it is efficient and delivers high quality and value to customers

2.	Sourcing: involves the selection of suppliers to deliver the raw materials that are necessary for the production of the firm’s product. Pricing, delivery and Payment processes are needed along with metrics for monitoring and improving relations between partners in business.

3.	Making: where the product is produced or service provided. Requires scheduling processes for Workers, coordination of materials, equipment etc. and also defining metrics such as production speed, quality produced, worker productivity etc. which monitor the process

4.	Deliver: referred to as the logistic process. Carriers picked and move products from warehouse to customer, coordinate and schedule movement of goods and info, develop and operate a network of warehouses and run info systems that manage the receipt of orders from customers

5.	Returning: involves processing old worn-out defective and excess products back from customers and support to customers who have issues with delivered products   e.g. after sales support

The SCOR Process extends from your suppliers supplier to your customers customer. This includes all customer interaction from order entry to paid invoice and all market interactions in between. The purpose of the reference model below gives us the ability to describe the process architecture in a way that makes sense to key business partners. Once the process has been captured, a Standard process reference model it can be measured managed and controlled

This model contains:
1.	Performance Metrics: Standard Matrices to measure process performance
2.	Processes: Standard Descriptions of Mgt Processes and a Framework of Process Relationships
3.	Practices: Mgt Practices that produce best-in-class performance
4.	People: Training and Skills Req. aligned with process, best practices and metrics

#### *_Supply Chain Management 2.0_*

While the SCOR model provides a detailed workflow structure which has proven to be very successful in many different companies and organisations, there is a new era emerging in this field. The rising attractiveness of multi-platforms is demonstrated in the increase in demand that is now required for TradeCard’s supply chain collaboration arenas (Salecka, 2009). Such platform allow for the connection of multiple financial bodies with several buyers and suppliers, allowing for the delivery of automated supply chain finance transactions (Salecka, 2009)

![Supply Chain Management 2.0](https://github.com/ULStats/MA4128Assessment-2018/blob/master/IOT/SCM%20Images%20Anthony%20Kavanagh/Supply%20Chain%20Management%202.0.jpg)

The Rai Technology University (Rai Technology University, 2009) describes this new focus in supply chain as: 

>“Web 2.0 is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users. At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity.

>SCM 2.0 leverages solutions designed to rapidly deliver results with the agility to quickly manage future change for continuous flexibility, value, and success. This is delivered through competency networks composed of best-of-breed supply chain expertise to understand which elements, both operationally and organizationally, deliver results, as well as through intimate understanding of how to manage these elements to achieve the desired results. The solutions are delivered in a variety of options, such as no-touch via business process outsourcing, mid-touch via managed services and software as a service (SaaS), or high-touch in the traditional software deployment model.”

#### *_Future of Supply Chain Management_*

![Supply Chain Management future](https://github.com/ULStats/MA4128Assessment-2018/blob/master/IOT/SCM%20Images%20Anthony%20Kavanagh/Supply%20Chain%20Management%20future.jpg)

With the innovation proposed by the Internet of Things, we will begin to see much more collaboration across the supply chain, not just in individual business functions of manufacturing, planning, quality, warehousing etc. With increase data processing information, up to date information will allow to the ease of decision making in addition to increase value to the customer in terms of shorter lead time, increased quality, right first time, zero defects among many others. For example, asset tracking is not new by any means current barcode scanners as a means of tracking and managing inventory by freight and shipping companies may soon become a thing of the past.  as Newer asset tracking solutions offer much more vital and usable data, especially when paired with other IoT technologies (Meola, 2016). These may include RFID tags, which provide data on items to which they're attached through RFID antenna and a microchip for storing information, with others incorporating their own battery power which can facilitate the integration of additional sensors (Meola, 2016)

Internet-connected trackers use long-range networks or Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) to let companies track specific items throughout their delivery journeys (Meola, 2016). In the same vein, satellite trackers provide location data on an item almost anywhere on the planet, even in areas that do not have cellular coverage (Meola, 2016). Bluetooth tags and beacons offer tracking data in smaller, more confined areas, and companies most often use them in retail stores to monitor customer traffic and offer marketing messages to said customers (Meola, 2016).

While the full extent of new technologies way not be fully known at present, we can be confident that supply chain management will become much more efficient and effective into the future at providing increase value to not just the customer, to also to each and every link on the supply chain. Increase visualisation and filter data allows for the generation of optimum solutions in aiding in the decision-making process.
