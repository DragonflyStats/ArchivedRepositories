## Overview

An artificial neural network is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Artificial 
neural networks are considered datsa modelling tools where the complex relationships between inputs and outputs are modellled or pattern 
are found.Information that goes through the network aﬀects the structure of the artiﬁcial neural network because a neural network 
changes (or learns) based on the input and output.

## Functionality

Artiﬁcial neural networks is just an attempt to make computers, model the brain. Neural networks mimic a collection of neurons. Just 
as they do in the brain these simulated neurons take inputs and give outputs through their connections. The connections between neurons 
can be strong or weak. These inputs are multiplied by weights. Weights are assigned with each arrow to represent information ﬂow. The 
weights are computed by a mathematical function, which determines the activation of the neuron. Another function computes the output of 
the artiﬁcial neuron. The neurons of this network just sum their inputs. Since the input neurons have one input, their output will be 
the input multiplied by a weight. If the weight is high, the input will be strong. By adjusting the weights of an artiﬁcial neuron we
can obtain the output we want for speciﬁc inputs. There are algorithms which can adjust the weights of the artiﬁcial neural network
in order to obtain the desired output from the network. The process of adjusting the weights is called learning or training. The 
training begins with random weights, and the goal is to adjust them so that the error will be minimal.

## Applications

Neural networks have been used in a wide variety of areas. Military applications include automatic target recognition, control of
ﬂying aircraft, engine combustion optimization, and fault detection in complex engineering systems. Voice recognition can be achieved by 
ANNs. In medicine ANNs are used for image analysis and has resulted in systems that detect tumours in medical images, and systems that 
classify malignant versus normal cells in cytologic tests. Time series predictions have been conducted by neural networks, including the
prediction of irregular and chaotic sequences. More recently, decision support roles for neural networks have emerged in the ﬁnancial 
industry and in medical decision support.
